## Folder description

* README.md: this file

* run_analysis.R: a script for performing the analysis
* tidy_all_means.csv.zip: a tidy data set as described in the instructions. Has average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the given data.

After all the preliminary work is done as described in the CodeBook one can run run_analysis.R to get the resulting file.
